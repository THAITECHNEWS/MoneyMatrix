# Google My Business Lead Generation Strategy

## Overview
Create 60-70 Google My Business locations to generate leads through your MoneyMatrix site's store locator.

## Strategy Components

### 1. Multi-Location GMB Setup

**Approach:**
- Create GMB listings for each major city/metro area
- Focus on high-traffic locations (LA, NYC, Chicago, Houston, Phoenix, etc.)
- Each location targets specific loan types (Payday, Title, Installment, etc.)

**Locations Strategy:**
- **Tier 1 Cities** (20 locations): Major metros (NYC, LA, Chicago, Houston, Phoenix, Philadelphia, San Antonio, San Diego, Dallas, San Jose, Austin, Jacksonville, Fort Worth, Columbus, Charlotte, San Francisco, Indianapolis, Seattle, Denver, Boston)
- **Tier 2 Cities** (25 locations): Secondary metros with high demand
- **Tier 3 Cities** (25 locations): Smaller cities with less competition

### 2. Lead Generation Flow

```
Google Search → GMB Listing → Store Locator Page → Lead Form → CRM
     ↓              ↓                ↓                ↓
   SEO          Reviews          Map Display      Contact Info
