## Content Creation Strategy

### Phase 1: State/Loan-Type Pages (315 pages)
**Priority:** HIGH
**Timeline:** 3-6 months
**Pages per week:** 12-15 pages
**Content:** Template-based, reusable sections

**Template Sections:**
1. Hero (state + loan type)
2. State regulations
3. Top cities (with links)
4. State statistics
5. All cities grid
6. How to apply
7. FAQs

**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours per page
**Total Time:** 630-945 hours (can be parallelized)

### Phase 2: City Hub Pages (300 pages) - OPTIONAL
**Priority:** LOW
**Timeline:** Later (after state/loan-type pages)
**Why:** Lower ROI, can add if needed
