## 🚨 Important Considerations

- Difficult maintenance

- Users prefer complete answers
- Better conversion potential with quality content

### 4. **Link Equity Distribution**
- Clustered approach allows better internal linking
- Pillar articles can accumulate more authority
- Better link equity flow throughout site

## ✅ Final Recommendation

**DO NOT create 900 individual articles.**

**Instead, create 46-50 comprehensive articles** organized in a pillar-cluster model:

1. **10-12 Pillar Articles** (high-volume, comprehensive)
2. **30-35 Cluster Articles** (focused, specific topics)
3. **5-10 Supporting Articles** (niche, long-tail)

This approach will:
- ✅ Maximize SEO value
- ✅ Improve user experience
- ✅ Build topical authority
- ✅ Reduce maintenance burden
- ✅ Increase conversion potential
- ✅ Avoid content cannibalization

**Priority:** Start with the 6 pillar articles covering the highest-volume questions, then expand to clusters.
